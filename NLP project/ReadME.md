## How to Use
1. Clone this repository and open the code files in your preferred IDE or Google Colab.
2. Install required Python libraries using `pip install`.
3. Load the Amazon reviews dataset (link or source to be provided).
4. Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
5. Modify the code to experiment with different preprocessing techniques or models.


## Overview
The "Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews" project aims to analyze customer reviews from Amazon and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and uses machine learning models for sentiment classification. The project helps in understanding customer feedback and can aid businesses in improving their services and products.

## Objectives
- To preprocess Amazon reviews for sentiment analysis.
- To classify reviews into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral.
- To evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate metrics.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas, numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - nltk: For natural language processing tasks.
  - scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
  - matplotlib, seaborn: For data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains Amazon reviews along with their corresponding ratings or labels. It includes textual data that serves as input for sentiment analysis. Pre-labeled datasets (if available) were used for supervised learning.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Loading**:
   - Loaded the dataset containing Amazon reviews and their respective sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Performed initial inspection of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenized the reviews into individual words.
   - Removed stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
   - Applied stemming or lemmatization to normalize words.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
   - Identified frequently used words in each sentiment category using word clouds.

4. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converted textual data into numerical format using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

5. **Model Building and Training**:
   - Implemented machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment classification.
   - Trained the models on the preprocessed dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compared the performance of different models to determine the best approach.

## Results
- Successfully classified Amazon reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
- Achieved high accuracy with Random forest.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of NLP and machine learning in deriving insights from textual data. By analyzing customer reviews, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.
